Frontend (React - Next.js):

User Interface: The main interface for users to interact with the app.
Web3 Integration: Handles connection to Ethereum wallets and blockchain interactions.


Backend (Node.js - Express):

API Server: Manages API requests and responses.
Authentication: Handles user authentication.
User Management: Manages user-related operations.


Database:

MongoDB: Stores user information and other app-related data.


Blockchain (Ethereum):

Smart Contracts: The core logic for NFT creation, marketplace, and bartering.
NFT Creation: Handles the creation of NFT products.
Marketplace: Manages listing and viewing of NFTs.
Escrow/Lock: Handles the locking and transfer of NFTs during the bartering process.


Development & Deployment:

Hardhat: Used for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.


Storage:

IPFS: Stores NFT metadata and associated files.



The arrows in the diagram show the interactions between different components. For example, the frontend communicates with the backend API and directly with the blockchain through Web3 integration. The smart contracts interact with IPFS for storing and retrieving NFT data.
This architecture supports the following flow:

Users create NFT products (frontend -> smart contracts -> IPFS).
NFTs are listed on the marketplace (smart contracts).
Other users can view and make offers (frontend -> smart contracts).
When an offer is accepted, both NFTs are locked by the smart contract.
Upon confirmation from both users, the NFTs are transferred (bartered).
Users can relist their newly acquired items.
